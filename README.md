Greetings, I am [Furqan Abbas], a Electrical engineer with a Graduated in Electrical Engineering from [GCUF].

My experience in software development spans over [3] years, and I have worked on a wide range of projects ranging from [Smartly control home appliances with multiple supplies and save energies]. I am proficient in [Python, Arduino IDE, Dev C++], and I enjoy learning new technologies and tools to stay up-to-date in the rapidly-evolving tech industry.

I believe in the power of open source software to enable collaboration and innovation, and I have made it a point to contribute to the community whenever possible.

In addition to my work in software development, I have mentored several students on research projects.

Feel free to explore my GitHub profile and reach out to me (frqnbbs010@gmail.com) if you have any questions or if you're interested in collaborating on a project.
